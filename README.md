## Narrative Story:
Container Terminal Management is an interesting issue in the world because each minute in Container Terminal directly related to US Dollars. The cost of big container ships are about 65000$ per day, so there must be proper management to avoid shipment delay.

We will construct a model that will show how containers are shipped by Container Ships (Mother and Feeders) and get detail insight of Container Terminal System and also apply some strategies for efficient cargo and also look it through different angles. The project is inspired by “Coast Project” that was Australian defence system and was developed for Scheduling Purpose.

The following figure explains the big picture of container shipment and Container Terminal process:-
