## Narrative Story:
Container Terminal Management is an interesting issue in the world because each minute in Container Terminal directly related to US Dollars. The cost of big container ships are about 65000$ per day, so there must be proper management to avoid shipment delay.

We will construct a model that will show how containers are shipped by Container Ships (Mother and Feeders) and get detail insight of Container Terminal System and also apply some strategies for efficient cargo and also look it through different angles. The project is inspired by “Coast Project” that was Australian defence system and was developed for Scheduling Purpose.

The following figure explains the big picture of container shipment and Container Terminal process:-

The Cargo is transferred form one destination to other destination. The Cheapest way to transfer Cargo is from sea. In early nineteen’s the Cargo was transferred from one destination to other in bulk or bag form. As the trade increases the time become most important factor to manage. So, there came need for Containers that all Cargo must be packed in Containers and transferred from one destination to other.

The cargo to container terminal is two way process. In one step the Cargo in Container comes to Container terminal via Turks or Trains. Here at gate; the verification of Containers is done. The verification includes the destination of container, cargo type it contains. The unique id is assigned to the container and it is stacked in the stacking area.

And in other, the Cargo come from sea (Container Ships) to the Container Terminal; here above same procedure is done but the means of transportation is sea. The Container Ship from one port loads the containers and come to the supplies to the desired port. But most of the time the container terminal is too much busy to unload the container at once so ships have to wait for their turn and they stay on anchorage area.

The ships which load or unload the container come to birth, and quay-side cranes do this job. The stacked container in stacking area are loading on the ship and the containers on the ships are stored at Stacking area with the help of quay-side cranes.

One important thing that is kept in mind during loading and unloading; the even distribution of containers on-board. Because if distribution of loading is not perfect then there will be chance that the ship will be tilt.

Since hundreds of containers are imported and exported per day, so there is need for Container Terminal Management. The following papers will be study for container terminal management and the model in cpn-tool will be build. And through ontology we will try to construct scheduling of container terminal:
- A Review of Decision Support Systems in Container Terminal Operations
- Market Driven Control in Container Terminal Management
- Evaluating Container Terminal Transshipment Operational Policies:An Agent-Based Simulation Approach
- A Market Based Approach to Container Port Terminal Management
- Prospects for Short Sea Shipping
- Using Simulation in Berth Planning at a Container Terminal
